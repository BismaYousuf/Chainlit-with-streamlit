This is a simple example demonstrating how to create and run an AI assistant agent using **Chainlit**, **OpenAI Async API**, and the **openai-agents** SDK.

---

## Features

- Loads environment variables from `.env`
- Uses OpenRouter API key for authentication
- Creates an AI agent with specific instructions
- Streams the AI response token-by-token to Chainlit chat UI
- Maintains agent instance per user session

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install chainlit openai-agents openai python-dotenv

A valid OpenRouter API key stored in .env file as:

ini
Always show details

Copy
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
How to Run
Clone this repo or save your script as main.py.

Activate your virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Always show details

Copy
# Windows
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
Run Chainlit app with:

bash
Always show details

Copy
chainlit run main.py -w
Open your browser at http://localhost:8000 to interact with the agent.

Code Overview
Loads environment variables via dotenv

Creates an async OpenAI client with OpenRouter base URL

Defines an AI Agent with a helpful assistant prompt

On chat start, the agent instance is stored in user session

On each user message:

A Chainlit message is created and sent immediately with empty content

The agent runs asynchronously and streams token responses

Tokens are streamed live to the Chainlit message

Final content updates the message

Notes
Ensure your OpenRouter API key is valid and has sufficient quota

The msg.update() method is used to finalize the message without arguments

For streaming token-by-token updates, msg.stream_token() is used
